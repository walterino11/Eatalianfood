Welcome to the Android SDK!

The Android SDK archive now only contains the tools. It no longer comes
populated with a specific Android platform or Google add-on. Instead you
use the SDK Manager to install or update SDK components such as platforms,
tools, add-ons, and documentation.

In order to start developing applications, you must install at least one
version of the Android platform using the SDK Manager.

This requires an Internet connection, so if you plan to use the SDK
offline, please make sure to download the necessary components while online.

To start the SDK Manager, please execute the program "SDK Setup.exe".

From the command-line you can also directly trigger an update by
executing:
  tools\android.bat update sdk

For more information, please consult the Android web site at
